🧩 Future Work / IoT Integration
For deploying with IoT Wearables, follow this direction:

## Edge Deployment Plan
Use a wearable device (e.g., Raspberry Pi + Heart Rate/SpO₂ Sensor)

Send data via MQTT or REST API to a cloud server

Append streamed data to a CSV log or database

Periodically re-run analysis with the AI model

Visualize live data with Streamlit or Plotly Dash

 Tools you could integrate later:

MQTT (Mosquitto)

Node-RED or Flask API server

Firebase or Supabase backend

Raspberry Pi + MAX30102 sensor
